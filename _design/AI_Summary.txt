I'm looking to build a Connect Four AI learning system using Python that will run on both Raspberry Pi and desktop platforms. While I understand development concepts, design patterns, and testing, I'm not a hands-on coder. I want to use AI as my programmer for this project. I need complete, working code that I can implement directly. The system should use reinforcement learning for the AI to teach itself through self-play, with a Flask web interface to visualize learning progress and allow playing against the AI. Technologies include PyTorch, Gymnasium, and Flask. 

I worked with AI to build out the overall structure and to build out the connect4 gameplay already. it has a fully working game with a CLI test harness.

It doesn't currently have AI or reinforcement learning. This is the next part.

Let me take you through the strcutre. 

I do not want any code right now. i want to align with you first before we start working on code.

For now, read through all of this carefully and then i want to tell you more about the AI integration.




# Connect Four Game Module - Project Summary

## Project Overview

I've developed a comprehensive Connect Four game module as the foundation for an AI learning system. This module provides all the core game functionality needed before implementing the reinforcement learning components. The implementation follows software engineering best practices including modular design, comprehensive logging, and thorough testing capabilities.
